After each lab assignment, there will be a homework set that will serve as both a review of material covered in prior labs
and a way to cover more material for upcoming labs.  

**The goal of all of these questions is education (not assessment!).**
They are worth some points toward your grade, directly, as a motivation to do
them, but the real value is that they will help you learn the course content;  your
understanding will ultimately be reflected in your exam scores, which
constitute the majority of your grade.  So, copying answers from your friends
or getting questions correct by guessing is a fruitless activity:
it will rob you of the chance to engage with this material in the most
educationally useful way.

You should already have some experience inputting answers to the system from the diagnostic and from Lab 01.  Nevertheless here is a brief review of what the buttons mean:

Each subpart of an exercise offers a place to input your answer, and
several buttons:

* <tt>Submit</tt>: sends your answer to the server to be checked for correctness.  You will be presented with information regarding the correctness of your answer.  You will be allowed to a limited number of submissions per question. After a submission, your answer will be givne a score. In the case of programming questions where your  code might be partially correct/incorrect the *Show/Hide Detailed Results* button can give you specific details about which test cases you failed.

* <tt>View Answer</tt>: displays an answer written by the staff,
below the detailed results from your last submission.  **Viewing the
answer to a question will prevent any further submissions to that
question. DO NOT DO THIS!!** Some questions have additional explanation available through a button
labeled "View Explanation," which becomes available after you have viewed the answer
for that question.

* Certain types of questions offer additional options.  For example, questions
that involve coding in Python typically offer a "Run Code" button that runs your
code and displays its output (or any error messages it produced) without scoring
your code and without using one of your limited number of submissions.

* Some questions will have hints that you can view.  You aren't penalized for viewing the hints, but try not to use them if you don't need to.

<section>Extra References</section>

If you've never programmed before, or if you'd like a good reference to lean on <a href="https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/" target="_blank">this book here</a> is a good fallback reference with lots of examples.  We won't follow it in this class, but please feel free to use it as a reference!  I like it a lot.

If you have CAT-SOOP trouble, or want to install Python on your own computer see the links below!:

<section>Required Exercises</section>

You've got to do these below:
<python>
do_exercises(_608_exercises_,False)
</python>


<section>Symbol Key</section>

Symbols for exercises correspond to the following events.  We'll also have a progress page hopefully posted by the end of week 1 for tracking your work.
